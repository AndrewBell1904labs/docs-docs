# Using npm

NPM is used to manage dependencies in your JavaScript projects.

## Installing NPM

It's recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your node versions. NPM is bundled with node, so installing nvm will also give you npm, but also allow you to support multiple node versions locally.

See the link above to install nvm.

## Updating NPM to v6

npm v6 has made significant improvements, and you should [check it out](https://medium.com/npm-inc/announcing-npm-6-5d0b1799a905)

Typically, you can update npm from the command line, but if you're using nvm, you'll want to [upgrade npm for nvm](https://stanko.github.io/nvm-updating-npm/)

## Set Default NVM

You can set NVM to automatically set to the stable version

`nvm alias default stable`
